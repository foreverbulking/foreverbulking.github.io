# Resume Hosting Guide

Welcome to my GitHub repository, where I, Nishan Sanyasi, demonstrate the process of hosting a Markdown-formatted resume using GitHub Pages. This README not only guides you through hosting your own resume but also applies the principles of modern technical writing as recommended by Andrew Etter.

## Purpose

The main objectives of this document are to:
- Illustrate a practical application of hosting a resume on GitHub Pages, providing a hands-on example.
- Discuss how this process embodies Andrew Etter's Modern Technical Writing principles, particularly the use of lightweight markup languages, static site generators, and distributed version control systems.
- Offer insights into creating and managing effective technical documentation using platforms like GitHub, complemented by tools such as Jekyll for a more refined control over the website's layout and design.

## Prerequisites

To effectively follow this guide, you should have:
- A GitHub account, enabling you to host and manage your files on a distributed version control platform.
- An introductory level understanding of Markdown and Git, essential for creating and maintaining technical documents and code.
- Your resume formatted in Markdown, which allows for straightforward content creation and formatting.
- Jekyll installed on your computer, useful for local website testing and ensuring your site appears as intended before publishing (optional but recommended for a complete understanding).

## Instructions

1. **Set Up Your GitHub Repository**
   - Create a new repository on GitHub named `<yourusername>.github.io`. This name is crucial as GitHub Pages automatically turns this repository into your hosting site.
   - Clone the repository to your local machine, providing you with a local copy to work on and test.

2. **Prepare Your Resume**
   - Format your resume in Markdown, enabling ease of formatting and adaptability. Name the file `index.md` to ensure GitHub Pages identifies it as the main page.
   - Add the `index.md` file to the root directory of your cloned repository, ensuring it's in the correct location for GitHub Pages to find and display.

3. **Publish Your Resume**
   - Commit and push your changes to GitHub using the commands `git add .`, `git commit -m "Publish my resume"`, and `git push origin master`. These commands add your changes, commit them with a message, and push them to your GitHub repository.
   - Once pushed, your resume will be accessible at `https://<yourusername>.github.io`.

## FAQs

**Q: Why is Markdown preferred over traditional word processors for technical documentation?**
A: Markdown's lightweight and readable format makes it easier to write, edit, and share documentation, especially within version control systems. Its simplicity and portability align with Andrew Etter's principles for efficient technical writing.

**Q: Why might my resume not appear immediately on my GitHub Page?**
A: After updating your repository, it can take a few minutes for GitHub Pages to process and publish the changes. Ensure your repository and file names are correct, and double-check your Git commands. If the problem persists, verify your GitHub Pages settings in the repository settings.
