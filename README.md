# Resume Hosting Guide

Welcome to the GitHub repository where I, Nishan Sanyasi, host my resume using GitHub Pages and Jekyll. This README will guide you through how to host your own resume on GitHub Pages, following the principles of modern technical writing as recommended by Andrew Etter.

## Purpose

This document aims to:
- Demonstrate how to host a resume on GitHub Pages.
- Explain the application of Andrew Etter's Modern Technical Writing principles.
- Serve as an example for creating and managing technical documentation using GitHub and Jekyll.

## Prerequisites

Before you start, ensure you have:
- A GitHub account.
- A basic understanding of Markdown and Git.
- Your resume formatted in Markdown.
- Jekyll installed on your computer for local testing (optional).

## Instructions

1. **Set Up Your GitHub Repository**
   - Create a new repository named `<yourusername>.github.io`.
   - Clone the repository to your local machine.

2. **Prepare Your Resume**
   - Convert your resume into Markdown format and name the file `index.md`.
   - Place your `index.md` in the root of your cloned repository.

3. **Install and Set Up Jekyll**
   - Install Jekyll by following the instructions on the [official Jekyll website](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/).
   

4. **Customize Your Site**
   - Edit `_config.yml` to personalize your site's settings.
   - Modify the layout files and styles in `_layouts` and `_sass` directories to customize the design.

## FAQs

**Q: Why is Markdown better than a traditional word processor?**
A: Markdown is lightweight, portable, and platform-independent. It simplifies content formatting and is ideal for version control systems.

**Q: Why is my resume not showing up?**
A: Ensure your repository is named `<yourusername>.github.io`, your resume file is named `index.md`, and you've pushed the changes to GitHub. It may take a few minutes for the changes to go live.
